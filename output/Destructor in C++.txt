hello everyone welcome to mess oh god me in this like job
of will understand destruct doors in c plus plus so without any
for the delay let's get started with this lecture and let's see
what other topics there is only one topic and the name of
the door because destruct doors so let's get started with the store
big and let's understand what is or destructive or destructed is a
special member function that is automatically boyd when an object goes out
of scoop or is explicitly delete it first of all destructor is
a member function of a specific plus it belongs to applause but
you do the special member function that gets spoiled automatically just like
a constructor but it is different from a constructor in the sense
that it gets cold or do magically when an object goes out
of school or of in an object is explicitly deleted we know
this is not the case with constructors are constructed his old vin
an object is created it is also automatically board but it is
gourd when an object is created not when it is destroyed in
case of destruct doors they are old automatic live in an object
goes out of scope or of in an object is explicitly deleted
as the name suggests destructed is meant to destroy something with the
help of a destructor vu julie destroyed the de dum members associated
with the object then an object goes out of school board of
and it is deleted now let's move to the second point it
does not have but on me doors and return type just like
constructor it does not have would return type but unlike constructors it
does not have but i'm does he do so does not have
any but meters at all between guess off constructors weekend boss but
i'm be doors but that is something we can not do in
case of destruct doors the toward point is a class can only
have one destructor we can only have one destructor bought a class
this is in contrast to constructors we know we can define multiple
constructors within a glass but there can be only one destructor possible
in a glass i hold these points are clear to you up
to the specific point now here's the for the point it is
called in reverse order of constructors this doors are always gold in
reverse order of constructors this point will be clear to you when
we discuss and example see blas plus program after understanding the example
it will be clear do you how the destructor on gold so
these are the points associated with destruct doors now hit is the
syntax off how to define the destructor nc plus plus destructive as
defined just like a constructor but we need to use the du
da symbol in front of deep last name or we can see
the name of the destructor we need to use this symbol this
symbol differentiates heard from a constructor also we cannot provide barometers with
in parentheses within breezes we can provide the gold for the destructor
now have to understanding the syntax v are ready to considered a
c plus plus program that will help us understand how destructive work
in c plus plus and how we can use them it is
the example program it i've included v i o stream head of
while and here i have defined the class buddy this is the
definition of the main function now to this glass i want to
define are dynamic ot that do with the help of an object
for this were both i have defined these to date are members
of this blas these are bribery du da members heavy have the
point da da da da do and in de jure this point
will point to the dynamic ot and here we have the variable
size to hoard the size of the ot this variable has type
in biggio now let's define the object of this blas this is
the object eod are one of glass or a and i have
initialized it to five we know in order to initialize an object
we usually define a constructor so let's define deconstruct off or this
blas it is the public constructor audi and to this public constructor
i have passed this but army door s this but i'm a
dog and receive the indeed your value that i have provided here
so as will receive value five now we can provide this value
to this video both size because this value is that he presenting
the size of the ot that we want to define dynamically saw
began directly right this line size equals s we can use the
size variable here because this constructed as defined in the glass this
is the public constructor and it can access the private members of
this class he had i've written size equals s saw the video
both size will receive value five and this variable is associated to
this object so this is a are one daughter size i hold
this is clear to you now let's define our dynamic ot we
already have this size in this glass began to find the dynamic
ot like this and i'm using the new operator to define the
ot here i'm defining the array of size number of indeed years
the variable sizes provided as the size of this study we know
that for this object variable size has value five so this will
be replaced by five this means we will get five blocks with
each blah org has the capability to store and indeed you're inside
heap and those blocks on consecutive to each other and from the
new operator will receive the address of the forced blog inside this
data pointer so now data is the point door to the audi
that has been allocated in heap and the audi has five blocks
and do them with each block and hold and indeed you now
i hold this gorgeous is completely clear to you after this let's
say i want to display the message to the user that the
he has been created successfully for this purpose i have written this
as to dc out statement this will display audio for specific size
created on the screen for the specific example and for this object
or a of size five created on the screen will be displayed
when be execute this program does as the output be really get
audio of size five created via getting five in place of this
video both size and that is true this shows that the he
has been created successfully and from this example it is clear that
whenever we create an object the constructor associate to the to dad
object will be called automatically we do not call deconstruct now we
also nor does that it is our responsibility to l a good
the memory that we have a located in heap for this purpose
we can define or destruct door the job of destructor is to
destroy the members associated with the object when an object goes out
of school or when it is believed to explicitly we know that
after completion of this line that is after execution of this line
zero will be returned to the operating system and the main function
will complete it's execution then this object goes out of scoop this
is the meaning of going out of scoop done it leaked the
scope of this object is this main function when the main function
completes it's execution then the object goes out of scope and of
in an object goes out of scope then the memory associated with
the object must be the are located i'm talking about this specific
memory block that v have a located in heap this memory must
be delegated because after completion of this main function we do not
need this already saw the destructor is the best fit here because
we know the destructor will be called when dysfunction completes the execution
so here we should define the destructor of this gloss this is
all we can define the destructor here i'm using the deal does
seem go to define the destructor every do not provide any barometers
within bruises weekend write the code for the destructor it i have
written discord with the help of this line the memory will be
a low gear dude which we have alligator dynamically with the help
of new operator this means the memory associated to the du da
point door which is indeed associated to the a r r one
object will be the i located i hold this is clear do
it i'm using delete operator for this purpose and i am providing
the data as the point though after this through as to d
c out audio of size five destroyed will be displayed on the
screen i'm talking about the specific example so many weeks ago this
program we know after this message will get this message body of
size five destroyed this destructor will be called when this function complete
execution heard this line will execute and because of this line the
memory associated with this point during dead dog will be be a
look good this point door is indeed associated to this object a
out on one so the audi of size five will be the
are located so this is all the program works for this specific
object no this is true for one object what if we have
multiple objects let's define one more object let's say we have this
object a ought to have this glass and i am initialize in
this object with value ten now i would like to ask this
question what will be the order of constructors and destructor goal in
this specific case let's understand this properly here i'm creating the object
eod are one of glass or you and i'm initialize and good
with five we know at this point the constructed will be called
the new what i will be get off size five in the
heap and message audio of size five created will be displayed on
the screen this is true after this it is not the gays
that the destructor will be called for this object it is never
the gays that the destructor will be called when the constructor completes
it's execution the destructor will be called when an object goes out
of school or when it is explicitly deleted so the destructor associate
to do this object will be called when it goes out of
school or when it does deleted explicitly after the execution of this
line we need to execute this line at this moment this object
is still in the scoop of this main function so the destructor
associate to do this object will not be called at this moment
at the time of execution of this line constructor associated to the
object a are allowed to will be called automatically and beard for
an array of size ten will be located in the heap he
oughta do da da da will point to that ot and already
of size and created will be displayed on the screen i hope
this is clear to you so we will get the message audio
of size five created and then audio of size ten created this
means constructors for board these objects will be called first and the
order will remain seen both deconstructed off a eod are one will
be called then deconstructed off a are do will be called now
what about the structures the know after execution of this line zero
will be returned to the operating system den the main function come
bleed seats execution this means we're done with the main function and
we're done with these objects as we are done with these objects
memory that we have are located in the heap for these two
objects must be a look located for this purpose the destructor must
be called on these two objects but the destructor will be poured
in the reverse order of constructors this is what we learned to
be last point if you remember the destruct doors must always be
called in the reverse order of constructors reno in this specific example
the constructors on gold in the same order that we have here
for the constructor for iraq one will be called then deconstruct of
on iraq who will be called now the destructor for these two
objects will be called in the reverse order close to the destructor
of a are to will be called then the destructor of iraq
one will be court i hope this is clear do you so
what happens in this case because the destructor of yacht or to
will be called forced the memory associated with a on our to
door data will be the are located this means the audio of
size den will be the are located and therefore will see the
message audio of size ten destroyed after this the destructor associated with
e r r one will be called this means the memory associated
with eod one da da da will be the are located and
this means the audio of size five will be delegated from heap
and beautiful rid of see the message audio of size five destroyed
so it is clear that when we execute this program will get
this out put on the screen audio of size five created audio
of size ten created audio of size ten destroyed then audio of
size five destroyed this output clearly shows the order of constructors and
destructor schools fourth deconstruct as or gold in the sequins e r
r one then he on do then the destructor gold golden the
reverse order that is the destructor of the iraq do is gold
first and then the destructor of the iraq one is called i
hope this is entirely clear to you so but those we have
understood destruct was properly we now know what is the role of
disruptors nz blah blah programs so it does we are done with
this topic destruct dose and we are done with this lecture oh
give runs this is it for now thank you for watching this
lecture i've been see you in the next one and
