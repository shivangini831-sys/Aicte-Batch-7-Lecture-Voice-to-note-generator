In the previous lectures be have understood three different types of constructors default but i'm it raised and copy constructor now in this lecture will understand new and delete operators these operators are important for us to understand so that we can easily cover the remaining topics off this job to in those topics we will use these operators so without any further delay let's get started with this lecture and let's see what other topics the post or because this lecturers introduction to new and delete operators last i will give you the introduction so that you will be enough motivated to get started with new when delete operators you will get to know why you should start he knew and delete operators in this topic then vivid moved to the second topic where we will understand new and delete operators for our audience so these other topics let's start with the first one introduction to new and elite operators so what are new and delete operators and why we should study them to understand why we should study new and delete operators let's consider one simple example let's see if we want to store five indeed years for this purpose we can create five different variables but we have already learned this that we do not have to create different variables to store similar kind of data instead we can create an audi and this is how we can define an a to store five five indeed jos inside the main function i have defined this or a a r r that can hold five indeed jos here i am industrializing this are a bit these values one two three four and five so in this way we can define this or day and vino of and we execute this program will not get any output but they will also not get any edit and this means or a will be created successfully this is all we can create an audio five indeed years but what if he want to create an audi who's size is provided by the user nord the program programmer here we are hard coding this value five but this time we want to create an audi which is off dynamic size this means the size is provided by the user and accordingly the ot should be created is this possible lindsay plus plus let's find out let's ride the program for the same here i have written this program inside the main function i've defined variable end this represents the size of the you i have written these two statements to accepted the value for in here to as giudice out i'm asking the user to endorse size for the or it will receive this size in the video will end with the help of to dc in statement now here we are providing this video will end with in brackets of the ot this means this size of the ot is in and this means the user will decide the size of this ot is it possible to define such an ot in c plus plus in c programming language we have something called variable length buddy this is how we define of variable and are you in c programming language but in c plus plus programming language we may be able to define this and are record would be able to run but this is not supported by c plus plus standard all the weekend right the sport and discord may work in your machine but it is also possible that it may not walk in some other machine with a different compiler because variable length already is the concept which is not supported by see blah blah standard so we should not define such a day because if you define and array a like this then our gourd becomes known portable we may not be able to run the scored on different machines we must always achieve portability that is our good should work on different machines with different compilers i would like to mention there's that gcc compiler does provide the extension for variable length bodies and therefore gcc compilers supports variable and or is in see plus plus programming language as well but that does not mean that other compilers also support variable and or is due to this reason we should not define an audi like does in c plus plus i hope this is clear to you now you might be thinking how do we define such an audi in c plus plus them in order to define such a dynamic or is in c plus plus we have to operators new and delete we will understand these two operators in the next topic property for now we have completed the introduction to new when delete operators now we know why we should study new and delete operators we should start a new and delete operators to define such a dynamic arrays read this we are done with the introduction now let's move to the second topic to understand new and delete operators for ortiz we now know why we should use new when delete operators now let's understand how we can use them it is the syntax that we can follow to use the new operator this is the syntax we need to provide the pointer variable forced then after the assignment operator we need to provide the new operator then the data type and within brackets we provide this size in this way if we can create a dynamic buddy now let's understand different parts of this statement first let's understand this expression which is written off to this assignment operator heavy have this new operator know what is new operator and what it does with the help of new operator we can allocate memory in something called heap we have to memories stack memory and heap memory stack memory is memory that allows us to store some value in it through a video bull that we define inside the function whenever we define a variable inside the function that variable will be stored inside the stack and it will be stored automatically we do not store it manually also it will be d aloe get dirt or began say the video will will be destroyed when the function completes it's execution so memory location and delegation happens automatically this is the case woodstock but this is not the case with heap heap memory works in a different way we need to explicitly asked for the memory in heap so whenever we want to allocate memory to store some data in heap we need to ask for that memory with the help of new operator that is why we use the new operator this means memory is allocated with the help of the programmer it will not be a located on it's own also we need to be a located the allocated memory ones the job is done and this can be done with the help of delete or breeder which we will understand in a moment for now let's focus on the new operator only through this operator began can allocate memory in heap now you might be thinking why do we allocate memory in heap what does the benefit that we will get why can't we simply a good memory in stack we allocate memory in heap because he allows us to create such dynamic bodies so if we allocate memory in heap then it is possible that we can define what is that are dynamic nature this means the size of the ot can be provided by the user so this is the benefit we get from heat nimby also whatever to be stored inside keep will remain there until we use the delete operator to be a look to the memory so it is our responsibility to are located the memory so that it can be used for other purposes i hope this is completely leo do you solve the help of this operator we can define dynamic or is inside heap after this new operator we need to specify the data type of the ot within brackets we need to provide this size of the ot in this way we can create a dynamic ot new operator also gives us the address of the memory that we have a located inside heap for the ot that address weekend stored in a special type of video boot which we call a pointer valuable that is why we have this assignment operator to do the assignment and here i have written point to the video boot because we need a pointer video able to store the address this is not a normal variable is is a special type of variable that can hold some address a normal valuable can only hold of value but appoint a valuable can hold address off some memory location so i hope this index is clear do you will understand this index more properly with the help of an example but for now we have the idea of what the new operator is and what it does now let's understand the syntax on the delete operators will this is how we can use the delete operator to delete a specific ot from the heap here we need to use the delete operator like this then we need to provide the brackets to tell that we want to delete and audi then we provide the point that variable which has the address of the ot or began see the point of variable that has the address of the memory that we have a located so in this way we can d allocate memory in heap salvi have understood these syntax was properly now we know how we can allocate memory in keep that is how we can define dynamic or is and how reagan the lead member your began say d l a good memory in heap now let's properly understand to was c plus plus program how we can use new when delete operators in our programs it is the program in front of you this is the main function i have defined variable and and i have zero initialized it this valuable and represents the size of the dynamic gaudy this variable and will receive some value from the user and this is done with the help of std see in then we have this statement were just following the same syntax of the new operator here you can observe that i've written new operator then i have provided the data type of the or it reaches end because i want to store indeed years and the size of this ot is and therefore with the help of this new operator v r l o getting memory for or any number of in yours this means br out and getting memory for an audi all sizes and and from the new operator we will receive the address of the forced to block of the ot we just see him as the address of the ot and this address weekend stored inside a pointer variable this is what i have specified in the syntax as well here i have defined this point that available it looks very similar to unknown would be able there's is only one difference here we have the asterisk a symbol this asterisk a symbol makes it different from a normal valuable here we are telling that this is the pointer variables that can hold some address this is not the normal variable so i've defined as pointer variable be and i have specified the data type as end i would like to mention this that this is not the data type of this point that a variable because pointer valuable can hold some address it cannot hold of value this data type represents the data type of the value which is pointed by this point but a video will be no pointer variable is holding some address in this specific example it is holding the address of these forced block of the already in that block v over reboot store and indeed your because we have i look good dude memory for any number of in be drugs so clearly this point to the variable is holding the address of some indeed your that is why the data type in is mentioned over you i hold this is completely clear do so with the help of this line we would be able to create a dynamic or a of size in a pointer variable be will hold the address of the first block of the ot as pointer video boobies wording the address of the first blog we can see this is similar to having the name of the array as be this point that variable be is holding the address of the forced block therefore we can say at this point to the video will be is representing the ot and to this point to can access and provide values to the ot whenever we want now here i have written this for new that allows us to provide values to the ot this waterlooville run from i equal to zero to i equal to and minus one this means this bottle will run and times oh here we have these two statements the for statement allows us to display message that makes use user to provide some value and with the help of this statement will received that value inside a specific block of the ot in order to understand the code that we just saw let's drivers the scored line by line he had i've defined variable in be know in this video will will receive some value from the user let's say the value provided by the user is three this means dynamic array of size three will be alligator didn't heap this is a true thing this is how the or he looks like hidden this or a we have three blocks because these size provided here is three by the user pointer variable be representing this or yeah that's why i have mentioned be over here also we can see the indices we know through the index we can access a specific block index of the force block a zero index of the second block is one and index of the toward block is too this or is located in heap now let's evaluate this for loop when i is the road this condition is true because zero is less than three therefore this statement will execute it i will be replaced by zero really get one this means enter value one will be displayed along with the and this is how it looks like this means we're asking the user to end to the fullest value of the body now let's say the first value provided by the user is in this value will be stored in be zero what is busy to be zero is the first block of the body saw this valuable be stored or would you in this we're be are storing the value inside heap i hope this is clear to you we are using be as didn't name of the ot and through the index vr accessing the specific block and i have provided variable i initially it will be replaced by zero saw that is why inside busy easy to we are getting value in after this eyes incremental by one i becomes one the no one is less than three therefore for the statement will again execute this time and good value do will be displayed because i is one here we will have one plus one which is too that's why we're seeing to here now let's say the second value provided by the user is twenty this value will be stored in location be he one this means at this specific location on this blog twenty will be stored in the same way the third value will be stored as well it will see this message and value three let's say use it has provided to the this value will be stored in this location now we have all the elements of the buddy at the end i becomes three and be no three is not less than three there for the for loop or terminate so in this v the for little bronze exactly in number of times and with the help of this for loop we would be able to provide values to the body i hold the scored is clear do you up to this point now what is happening after to this i have written this board that allows us to access these values and bring them on the screen and i've ever done this for look for this purpose heard this for loop runs from i equal to zero two i equal to in minus one this means this board loop also runs and times when i have zero this condition is true and therefore this std see out statement will execute we will have been zero we know what is busy it'll be zero is ten so ten will be displayed along with the space then i becomes one and we will get be one be one is twenty so twenty will be displayed along with space then told david be displayed along with space and when i become three we will get outside this loop so this way discord works and we'll see this output ten twenty thirty on the screen so would this be have understood this scored up to this point now we know how to use the new operator in a c plus plus program to create a dynamic or a like this now it is our responsibility to d allocate memory for this buddy doctors it is odd a responsibility to delete this already now this can be done with the help of believed operator if we do not do this then the memory will remain occupied and no one can use this maybe so we need to the yellow good the memory here i have written this line to the yellow good this memory i've provided the delete operator than the brackets and then the name of the point that a variable which is representing the attack itself saw this body will be wiped out from the men body i hope this idea is completely clear do you add the hand to be have returned zero we know zero will be returned to the operating system and the program has successfully executed this is the output we are getting so in this way we can use new and delete operators in c plus plus programs with this we have understood new and bleed operators for or is now we know how we gonna a dynamic or is with the help of these operators this means we are done with the second topic also and we are done with this lecture oh good this is it for now thanks for watching this lecture i will see you in the next one and
