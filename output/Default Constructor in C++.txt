Hello everyone welcome to know so i got be we have complete job the number five object oriented programming 
in see blas blas now we are in job the number six and the name of this job to those guns doctors and destruct
was in this job job even properly understand constructors and destruct us we're starting this job do with 
this lecture and the name of this lecturers default constructor sold without any further delay let's get
started with this lecture and let's see what other topics divorced or of this lecturers introduction to
constructors forced i will introduce you to constructors because this is the first time you are encountering 
constructors then driven move to the second topic where we will understand default constructor property so
these are the door pics or this lecture let's start with the first topic doctors introduction to constructors 
so what are constructors before understanding what are constructors let's first understand through an example
program why do we need constructors it is the example program here i have defined this blah student with
private member's rule number and name name is off type string and that is why string header file is included 
these are the public member functions said they dine display said it function allows us to said values for 
rule number and name why are but army doors are and in and this is the display a function that allows us to display
rule number and name on the screen in a specific format it is the main function and in this main function
i've defined the object of the class student aid you can observe the object name is s and through this object 
i'm calling this said do not function and i am providing values one zero one and bob to rule number and name 
respectively this means i am initial i think this object providing values to the private member's wire an 
object is same as initialize in the object also i'm calling the display function through the as object 
this means rule number will be replaced by one zero one and name will be replaced by bob we will 
see the output rule number as one zero one and name as bob i hope this is do you do you deal now we 
are setting the values of the private members of via an object to of function and that to a member 
function this is what we were doing till now this is how we were initialize zinc an object in other 
words this is what i've mentioned here but this is not how c plus plus wants this this is against
the main goal of c plus plus do you know what is the main goal of c plus plus the main goal of 
see blah blah us is to make the user defined data type mimic the behavior of the build been data type been know what building data types indeed yours lords characters these are building data types let's say we define a variable of typing de jure we do not have to call the function to initialize the video above reagan initialize the variable directly are the assignment operator but here when we define an object of the user defined type which is a glass then we need to call the function to initialize the object this means the user defined data type at this moment is not mimicking the exact behavior of the built in data type in order to initialize the object a user defined data type we need to ball a function explicitly this is not what we want this is not the main goal of c plus plus in order to achieve the main goal of c plus plus that is making the user defined data type mimicking the behavior of built in the dark type we have something called constructors in see plus plus this is the reason why we need to study constructors because constructors allows us to initialize objects without the need to call functions explicitly i hold this is clear to you now let's understand what our constructors it is the definition of the constructor a constructor is a special member function that is used to initialize objects offered plus it is a member function but it is a special type of member function that is used to initialize objects offered plus know why are we calling this a special member function the reason is simple it has the same name as the glass and it does not have a return type also it is involved automatically when an object of the classes created so when we cleared an object of the claws it will be involved or called automatically we do not have to ball deconstruct constructor on our own explicitly it has the same name as the glass and it does not have a return type that is why it is called a special men but function i hold this is clear do you through a constructor weekend initialize objects offered plus and this can be done without the need of calling the function explicitly so in this way we can mimic the behavior of a built in data type two more user defined the data type also most commonly it was declared under public access busy via we do not usually declared it under the private excess specify although we can do this but mostly we declared a constructor under the public access specified so that the concept of constructors now let's see what are the different types of constructors we have in c plus plus we have many different types of constructors but in this cause vivid study for major type self constructors these are the four major types the first one is default constructor the second one is but i'm be derived constructor the third one is bobby constructor and the fourth one is move constructor so these are the major types of constructors we have see plus plus which real study in this chapter in this lecture we will understand default constructor properly for now we are done with the introduction to construct does this means we are done with this topic now let's move to the second topic to understand default constructor properly now what is the default constructor default constructor is the deconstructer that gets cold or involved automatically when an object is created without providing any arguments default constructor is just like a normal constructor it gets cold when an object is created but it is called the default constructor because we do norte supply but army doors to the constructor and therefore it does not accept any arguments now let's see how we can define our default constructor and see blas plus through and example program it is the example program i have defined this blast student with private member's rule number name these are public member functions student and display have you can observe this is not the normal member function this member function does not have will return type also the name of this member function as same as the name of the glass so it is deconstructer this is the special type of member function that is used to initialize objects offered glass i hope this is clear to you and this is the default constructor because it does not accept any arguments because it does not have any barometers here you can observe that this default constructor is providing default values to rule number and name rule number will receive value zero and name will receive unknown i will this make sense to you saw to the default constructor we can provide default values to private member's why are an object we do not have to call dysfunction explicitly it will be ball then we will create the object of this glass it is the member function display with return type as boyd this allows us to display rule number and name in a specific format on the screen this is the definition of the main function inside this main function i have created this object s because the object as is created deconstructer will be invoked it will be involved automatically and therefore rule number will receive zero and name will receive the string unknown these values are associated with this object so this object is initialized without the need of calling the function on our own so here we are mimicking the behavior of a big been data type as soon as the object is created it is initialized with values now here i'm calling the display of function to the as object and you do this reason this rule number will be replaced by zero and name will be replaced by this drink unknown so when we execute this program will get the output rule number as your name as unknown i hope this is completely clear to you so in this way we can define or default constructor now here's a question for you what do you think what happens when we do not to define the default constructor default constructed as then provided by the compiler this is what i've written here if constructed as nor defined then compiler will provide the default constructor on it's own and to the default constructor compiler will provide garbage va i lose to the private members except these string variable this drink variable will receive the empty string it is the example program be dog before as well but this time we do not have the constructor the default constructor is provided by the compiler as good as nor constructed here not to that default constructor rule number will receive a garbage value and this name variable will receive an empty string he had i've created the object of glass student dear for the default constructor provided by the compiler gets involved and this means rule number will receive the garbage value and name will receive the empty string and because we're calling the display function through the s object we will see this output on the screen in my guess i am receiving this garbage value in your guess you may receive a different value but the point to note here is that this is the garbage value and the name variable has received the empty string that is why you're not seeing any tingle we here so would this be have brought but he understood default constructors and as means be are done with this topic was so and we are done with this lecture org governs this is it for now thank you for watching this lecture i didn't see you in the next one and
