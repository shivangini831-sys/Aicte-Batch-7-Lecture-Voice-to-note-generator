In the beavers like jovi have understood default constructor which is the force type of bonds doctor now in this lecture the will understand but i'm be rise to constructor which is the second type of constructor in c plus plus so without any further delay let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics there's only one topic and the topic name is but i'm be derived constructor now let's understand what is but i'm me to rise constructor but i'm too nice constructor is a constructor that can dig arguments as the name itself suggests constructor is but i'm be derived this means it has parameters and therefore it can accept arguments this is in contrast to the default constructor because we know in case of default constructor weekend nord pas arguments because default constructor does not have but our meters but that is not the case with but i'm be used constructor also it helps in providing initial values do an object at the time off creating the object so true the but i'm he tries to construct do we can provide initial values to the object and that do at the time off creation of the object now do understand this properly and to understand how we can define and use but i'm tries to constructor let's take one simple see blas plus program it is the example program i have defined glass student with private member's rule number and name these are public member functions student and display this is the constructor precisely this is the behrami derived constructor because this constructor has some but i'm indoors heavy have to but i'm be doors are and and through these parameters we are passing values to rule number and name vagina private members of this glass it is the display function and through display function begun displayed rule number and name on the screen now here's the definition of the main function inside this main function as is the object of glass student that i have created and i have initialized this object with these values here i am using the copy initialization to initialize this object as why am i calling this copy initialization because here you can observe i am using the assignment operator we know this already this is the way we initialize an object and this is boy the copy initialization with the help of this index the will be called and these values will be boss to these but meters and this means indirectly these variables will be initialized rule number will receive one zero one and name will receive this drink alice i hope this is clear to you and these values are associated to this object therefore we have initialized this object with these values now when recall the display function through the object as then we know that this role on board will be replaced by one zero one and named will be replaced by alice so by the execute this program that will get the output rule number one zero one and name alice now i would like to mention that this is not the only way off initialization this is even more deep breath for the off initialization we should not use the copy initialization to initialize objects we have another view of initialization which is called the direct initialization this is how the direct initialization looks like we need to provide values directly to the object this is how we can follow the direct initialization this is the preferred v of initialization now we know again when we execute this program will get the same output rule number one zero one and name and as we have just changed the matter of initialization the entire board is exactly the same as before now what happens when we do not initialize this object that is we do not provide these values and we simply create this object like this if you create this object without initial i think it then the default constructor must execute at this moment the but i'm advised constructor will not execute because we need to boss values to these parameters in order to all this constructor but here we are not industrializing this object therefore the default constructor must execute but there is no default constructor that the have defined in this class we learned this already in the last lecture that if you do not provide the default constructor on our own then the compiler will provide the default constructor now what do you think what happens in this case does the compiler blue wide the default constructor doors know the answer to this question is no compiler will not provide the default constructor on it's own this is because we already have the but army to rise to construct or a not class default constructor is provided by the come by know when there is no constructor in the class but we have the but i'm be derived constructor therefore the default constructor will not be provided by the compiler as did as nor default constructor therefore we will get error from the compiler so if you only have the but i'm to rise constructor then we need to pass arguments via this object to initialize the that i'm be derived constructor that is to provide values to the parameters of the bottom be derived constructor i hold this idea is clear do you solve this be have properly understood that army derived constructor and this means we are done with this topic and we are done with this lecture oh governs this is it for now thank you for watching this lecture i will see you in the next one and
