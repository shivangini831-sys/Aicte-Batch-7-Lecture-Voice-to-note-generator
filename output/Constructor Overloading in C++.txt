I'll do now we have studied default constructor and but i'll be derived 
constructor and you might be having this question in mind whether is it
possible to define multiple constructors within a glass or not we'll try
to answer this question in this lecture the name of this lectures constructor
overloading so without any further delay let's get started with this lecture
and let's see what other topics the only topic of this lectures constructed overloading 
so let's proceed for the and lives understand what is constructed overloading just like 
function overloading it is possible to define multiple constructors in the same glass with
different set of parameters because we know constructor is just like a function as we can 
do function overloading nc blas plus we can also do a constructor overloading this means 
we can overlord guns doctors that as we can define multiple constructors in the same laws
but the condition is that they must have different set of parameters also compiler decides
which construct to do paul based on the arguments based on the arguments be bars while the 
object was specific constructor will be called and this is decided by the compiler and it
helps inflexible object initialization if he can define multiple constructors within a glass
then we would be able to initialize objects in different ways therefore it leads to flexible
object initialization now let's properly understand how reagan overlord guns doctors nc plus 
plus with the help of a c plus plus program it is the program i have defined the glass to do 
with private member's rule number and name and these are public member functions head you 
can observe we have the default constructor and through this default constructor v are 
providing default values to roll lumber and name rule number will receive zero and name 
will receive this trend unknown now here is the but i'm utilized constructor because this
constructed has been on meters every have but i'm be doors are and and and through these 
but army does we are providing values to rule number and name after this we have the display 
of function which allows us are displayed rule number and name on the screen inside the main
function i have defined the object as one of blah student i have only defined this object i 
have not initialized this object did for the default constructor will be called this makes
sense to and did for rule number will receive zero and name will receive this string unknown
and these values are associated do as one object therefore if he called the display function
to the us one object women see the output as rule number zero and knee name unknown after
this i have defined this object as to of law student i have not only to find this object
i've also initialized this object this is what you can observe this is the direct 
initialization we have learned in the last lecture here i'm providing these values
to these but on me doors this is because the but be constructed will be called and
these but on be doors will receive these arguments and these values are indirectly 
bars to roll number and name so when we call the display function to the as to 
object we will receive the output as it all number one zero one and name alice 
so the northern the execute this program will get this outboard rule number 
zero name unknown rule number one zero one named alice as so through this program
began understand that it is possible to overlord constructors that is reagan define 
multiple constructors where the different set of parameters with this we have understood
constructor overloading this means we are done with the topic of constructor over loading
and this means we are done with this lecture as well oh governs this is it for now 
thank you for watching this lecture i would see you in the next one and
