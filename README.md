Lecture Voice to Notes Generator

An AI-powered web application that converts lecture audio into structured text notes using Speech Recognition technology.

📌 Project Description

The Lecture Voice to Notes Generator is designed to help students automatically convert recorded lectures into written notes.

Many students face difficulty in writing notes while listening to lectures. This project solves that problem by converting speech (audio input) into readable text using an AI speech recognition model.

The system is built using Python and Streamlit and uses the Vosk Speech Recognition model for offline transcription.

🎯 Objectives
